Why web development?

I've always loved computers but never thought I could make a living working with them.  I eventually drifted into another industry before I finally decided to return to what I always loved doing.   

I am a few weeks into the program at the Flatiron School and have experienced frustration followed soon by a great sense of accomplishment.   I've even experienced dreaming of coding!  I have dreamed of creating the Tic Tac Toe program successfully but then woke to realize it was just a dream.  Let me tell you, it was very upsetting.  

I look forward to completing the program and starting my career in coding.
