I took a short time from the program to work on a few personal things which haven't resolved but I needed a break from something.  When I last logged on I was working on my Tic Tac Toe with AI project and I was struggling a bit near the end.  I'm eager to get back into the program and continue on to the next section to grow as a developer :) :)  I like being able to call my self that!! My next blog post will include the code I struggled with along with how I finally reached passing code.  

Until Next Time!!
