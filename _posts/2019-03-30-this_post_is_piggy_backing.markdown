I came across another student's blog about moving from a IDE to a local environment and I related to everything she said in her blog!  Within in this past week I've tranferred from a IDE to a local environment with the assistance of a coach by the name of Micah.  He created this Github repo [Setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux for Development](https://github.com/micahshute/wsl-setup).  I am only two days into working in a local environment but I've really appreciated the capabilities and luxuries.  Like this other student mentioned, I can step away for hours if needed not worry about IDE timing out and losing work (this happened to me too many times!).  And while I am still grasping the shortcuts and trying to find out what setting work be for me, I starting to feel like a real life developer!  The training wheels are off and I'm ready to take Ruby by the Rails!!
