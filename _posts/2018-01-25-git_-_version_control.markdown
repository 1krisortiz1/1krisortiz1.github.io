# Git - Version Control
Git is version control which is the process of storing multiple versions of a single project.  The process of version control allows versions to be recalled later.  I could see this being a life saver should one need to revert to a previous version in a matter of a few seconds.  Learn.co gives the example of having just deployed a new feature on a chat app when your boss runs to your desk excited saying that the deploy can't happen yet!  The version control feature of Git makes it easy to roll back to the preferred version.  

The Flatiron school uses a distributed version control system which allows multiple users to access a complete copy of an entire repository and work independent of any network connection later pushing any changes to the server upon reconnecting.  

I’ve just completed my first lab in the Git Repository lessons in which I seriously struggled which had me puzzled because I felt that I had a good grasp of the lessons I’d just read through.  I finally enlisted the assistance of a coach by asking a question.  The coach was helpful in helping me pass the lab, but she was also confused about what exactly is being asked of the lab.  It turns out I had missed the part where I was being asked to make a change, any change to the Readme file which I would then push through.  tI was such a simple task but never the less, I missed it.  

Next...Git Collaboration!
