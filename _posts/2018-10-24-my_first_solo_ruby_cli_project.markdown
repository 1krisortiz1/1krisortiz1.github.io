**This was by far the hardest part of the program for me. ** 

I struggled quite a bit and considered taking a break due to multiple reasons.  I knew I wanted to code for a living but felt that there were too many things against me but I had to stop and remind myself of the reasons I was doing this.  I had to remind myself what I had done up to this point to be in this program and what my goals were for my future career and lifestyle.  

**A little about me during the start of the program...**

I started this program while I was unemployed but not long after enrolling I had a few changes in life that required me to return to work and the job I was returning to was six days a week 10 hours a day.  Luckily that job was only temporary and lasted for twelve months.  During those twelve months time spent on Learn was spotty and I wasn't really absorbing the lessons that I was completing.  

**I almost quit...**

And here comes the CLI project.  I knew I would struggle a bit but I didn't think I would get to the point where I considered taking a break from the program but that is exactly what happened.  I kept hitting walls and couldn't understand why everything I had learned was for some reason unaccessible, and I started doubting myself. After throwing a pitty party and realizing that I needed to ask for help for things in my personal life so that I could relieve some stress, I reached out for help.  And what was amazing to me was that I received help, all I had to do was ask.  

**A new start...**

I actually decided to take the time to start the program over.  I went back to the welcome lesson and started fresh and I am glad I did.  I was able to review and complete lessons back to back which made the learning process easier.  And because I was already familiar with the material was able to absorb and retain more than I did first time around.  I once again reached the CLI Gem Project and worked my way through it.  I still struggled a bit but I felt confident about my ability to search online for solutions.  After a couple of drafts and a lot of code I finally finished my project. 

My project allows users to view meetups by category and then provides a link for more information.  I still have a lot of refactoring to do but I am glad to finally finish.  One of the main issues I recognize is repeat code so I will need to work on refactoring methods to make my program DRY-er.  

**In the end...**

I'm not yet a Ruby expert and I know the learning never ends but I have my confidence back and I'm ready to move forward with the CLI project review, refactor, etc.
